Pim Stones - We Have It All

There was fire around us
So I should have known why
The touch of his hands
Were as cold as his eyes
So don't you tell me
We weren't hypnotised
Woh-oh
Oho-hoh
The print was so small
I didn't understand
He cut our thumbs
And placed a feather in our hands
Told us we would see
All our dreams and plans unfold
Oho-hoh
Our hearts we have sold
For diamonds and gold
But hey baby, take a look
We have it all
All my life I've been heading for hell
But never had I thought
I'd drag you down as well
I just couldn't resist
What he was trying to sell
Woh-oh
Oho-hoh
There's glory ahead
But our love will be forgotten
If my heart was still mine
I would go to the bottom
And apologize to you
Until the day it went rotten
Woh-oh
Oho-hoh
But haven't you heard
Hearts turn to dirt
Along with the rest of your body
It's all claimed by the earth
It will fade and it will wither
But gold, it will never
And hey baby, don't you know
Diamonds are forever
Da-da-da-dau-dau da da-dau
Da-da da-da-da-dau-dau da da-dau
Da-da da-da-da-dau-dau da-da-da-dau
Woh-oh
Oho-hoh
Hear me
Can you hear me
I am calling out to you
For the last time
Our hearts we have sold
For diamonds and gold
But hey baby, take a look
We have it all
And haven't you heard
Hearts turn to dirt
Along with the rest of your body
It's all claimed by the earth
Hear me (da-da-da-dau-dau da da-dau)
Can you hear me (da-da da-da-da-dau-dau da da-dau)
I am begging from you (da-da da-da-da-dau-dau da da-dau)
For the last time (woh-oh oho-ho)
Hear me (da-da da-da-da-dau-dau da da-dau)
Please forgive me (da-da da-da-da-dau-dau da da-dau)
I am calling out to you (da-da da-da-da-dau-dau da da-dau)
For the last time (woh-oh oho-ho)
