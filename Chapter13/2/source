All the beauty in your face
When all the anger separates us
Smile when you're not afraid to die
But I'm afraid with each goodbye
Lost the sun above my head
Lost myself in things
I said
And war is all you ever seen
Your war behind the screen
And all it means to me
When you are numb
I'm forgiven
I'm forgiven
When you've been gone
Lost in the lapse again
Lost in the lapse again
