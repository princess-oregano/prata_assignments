If I erase mistakes
If i relive this day
If it all goes away
Am i still human
Try to feel myself
But my skin is cold
Now I'm pulling everything to pieces
While i fall asleep
Paint a universe
On the ceiling
Then it consumes me
Weight off my two feet
From a towering cliff
Now i'm falling down
Falling infinite
Break a tall glass door
With my hollow fists
If you saw this you'd know
What you're missing
Weight off my two feet
From a towering cliff
I am falling down
Falling infinite
